#In survey weighted descriptive analyses of NHANES 2021–2023, about 8.4 percent of adults without hypertension (ht_bp = 0) reported having ever been told they had cancer (95 percent confidence interval 7.4 to 9.4 percent). Among adults with hypertension (ht_bp = 1), the estimated prevalence of any self reported cancer was 18.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval 16.7 to 20.5 percent). In other words, before adjusting for potential confounders such as age, sex, and race or ethnicity, adults with hypertension in this dataset had roughly double the prevalence of a self reported cancer diagnosis compared with adults without hypertension.

#From the table (exponentiated estimates):

#Hypertension (ht_bp): OR ≈ 1.23 with 95% CI 1.07 to 1.42, p ≈ 0.01.

#Interpretation: After accounting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, adults with hypertension have about 23 percent higher odds of reporting a cancer diagnosis compared with adults without hypertension. The confidence interval does not include 1, so this association is statistically significant.

#Age categories (ref = 20–39): 40–59: OR ≈ 3.69 (95% CI ~2.40 to 5.70), 60–79: OR ≈ 14.66 (95% CI ~9.45 to 22.75), 80+: OR ≈ 24.96 (95% CI ~15.12 to 41.20)
#Interpretation: Odds of cancer rise steeply with age, especially from 60 years and above, which is exactly what we expect.
#Sex (ref = Male):
#Female: OR ≈ 1.11 (95% CI ~0.90 to 1.38), p ~0.27
#Interpretation: No clear evidence of a sex difference in cancer odds after controlling for hypertension, age, and race.
#Race (ref = Hispanic):
#Non Hispanic Black: OR ≈ 1.06 (CI ~0.66 to 1.72), not significant
#Non Hispanic White: OR ≈ 2.42 (CI ~1.65 to 3.55), significant
#Other: OR ≈ 1.79 (CI ~1.18 to 2.72), significant

#Diabetes diagnosis (diab_dx) OR ≈ 1.36, 95% CI ≈ 1.05 to 1.76 (p ≈ 0.027)
#After accounting for age group, sex, and race or ethnicity, adults with a diagnosed history of diabetes had about 36 percent higher odds of reporting any cancer compared with adults without diabetes (OR 1.36, 95 percent CI 1.05 to 1.76). The confidence interval does not include 1, and the p value is below 0.05, so this association is statistically significant in the survey weighted model.

#Older age groups had progressively higher odds of cancer compared with adults aged 20–39, with particularly large increases for ages 60–79 and 80 plus, while odds were higher among non Hispanic White and “Other” race groups compared with Hispanics; sex and non Hispanic Black race were not statistically significant after adjustment.

#In survey-weighted analyses of 7,809 adults aged 20 years and older, the weighted prevalence of any self-reported cancer was 11.6 percent (SE 0.5 percent). Cancer prevalence increased sharply with age and was higher in Non-Hispanic White adults compared with Hispanic adults but did not differ significantly by sex.

#In age-, sex-, and race-adjusted models, hypertension and diabetes were each associated with substantially higher odds of cancer. Adults with a history of hypertension had 23 percent higher odds of any cancer compared with those without hypertension (OR 1.23, 95 percent CI 1.07 to 1.42), and adults with diabetes had 36 percent higher odds (OR 1.36, 95 percent CI 1.05 to 1.76).

#Using a 4-component definition of metabolic syndrome (large waist circumference, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes), metabolic syndrome was not significantly associated with cancer in complete-case analysis (OR 1.12, 95 percent CI 0.95 to 1.33). After imputing missing risk-factor data with multiple imputation, the estimated association strengthened modestly (OR 1.18, 95 percent CI 1.00 to 1.39, p = 0.052), suggesting a possible but imprecise positive relationship between metabolic syndrome and cancer.

#This figure shows adjusted odds ratios for any self reported cancer. Each dot is an odds ratio, and the horizontal line shows the 95 percent confidence interval. Cancer odds rise sharply with age; for example, adults 60 to 79 years have roughly 15 times the odds of cancer compared with adults 20 to 39 years.Non Hispanic White and Other race groups also have higher odds than Hispanic adults. Metabolic syndrome is associated with about 18 percent higher odds of cancer, but the confidence interval just touches 1, so this is suggestive rather than definitively significant.

# BMI (continuous) by MetS
survey::svyttest(bmi ~ mets4_imp, nhanes_design_imp, na.rm = TRUE)

```
#Interpretations

## 1. Sex by MetS
#There was no evidence that sex differed by MetS status. The proportion of men and women was almost identical in the MetS and non-MetS groups (about 48–52 percent in each). The sex distribution was similar in adults with and without metabolic syndrome (Rao–Scott p = 0.97).
---
## 2. Age group by MetS

#MetS was much more common at older ages. Adults with MetS were shifted into the 60–79 and 80+ groups, while adults without MetS were mostly in the 20–59 range. Age distribution differed strongly by metabolic syndrome status, with MetS concentrated in older adults (Rao–Scott F ≈ 189, p < 0.0001). Fewer than 10 percent of adults with MetS were aged 20–39 years, compared with about 47 percent of those without MetS.
---
## 3. Race or ethnicity by MetS

#Race and ethnicity were associated with MetS. Non-Hispanic White adults made up a larger share of the MetS group, and “Other” race a smaller share, compared with the no-MetS group. Race and ethnicity differed by MetS status (Rao–Scott p = 0.0002), with Non-Hispanic White adults comprising a larger proportion of those with MetS and adults in the “Other” race category less represented in the MetS group.
---
## 4. MetS components vs MetS (ht_bp, diab_dx, chol_high, waist_high)

# Each of these is one of the components used to define MetS, so strong associations are expected. As expected, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, and central obesity were far more prevalent among adults classified as having MetS than among those without MetS, with all Rao–Scott p values < 0.001.
---
## 5. Mean age and BMI by MetS (design-adjusted Wald tests)

### Age: Adults with MetS were on average about 17 years older than those without MetS, and this difference is highly statistically significant. On average, adults with MetS were 16.6 years older than those without MetS (95 percent CI 15.1 to 18.2 years, p < 0.001).

#BMI: MetS was strongly associated with higher BMI. Adults with MetS had BMI about 5 units higher on average.


#Mean BMI was 5.0 kg/m² higher among adults with MetS compared with those without MetS (95 percent CI 4.3 to 5.7 kg/m², p < 0.001).

#Interpretation:
#In survey weighted descriptive analyses of 7,809 adults, 32 percent met the 4-component definition of metabolic syndrome. Sex distribution was similar by MetS status (Rao–Scott p = 0.97). In contrast, adults with MetS were substantially older and had higher BMI than those without MetS, with mean age 16.6 years higher and mean BMI 5.0 kg/m² higher in the MetS group (both p < 0.001). Age category and race or ethnicity were strongly associated with MetS (Rao–Scott p < 0.001 for both), with MetS concentrated in the 60–79 and 80+ age groups and more frequent among Non-Hispanic White adults. As expected, each MetS component (hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, and central obesity) was far more common among adults classified as having MetS (all p < 0.001).
